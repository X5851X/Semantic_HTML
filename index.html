                <h2 class="plant-title">Hibiscus</h2>
                <p class="plant-description">Hibiscus is a flowering shrub that evokes an image
                    of a vivid tropical paradise, with flowers that come in a rainbow of colors.
                    Tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) is what's commonly seen in garden
                    centers and landscapes. It is thought to have originated in tropical of Asia.
                    Hibiscus flowers can be many colors, come in single or double forms, and often
                    last for just a day. Individual flowers may be short-lived, but the plant will
                    produce blooms over a long flowering season—nearly year-round in South Florida.
                    Hummingbirds are attracted by hibiscus; many types of butterflies are as well,
                    including Cloudless Sulfurs, blues, and Gulf Fritillaries. Hibiscus range in
                    size from low spreading shrubs to upright tree forms that can reach twenty feet
                    in height. Some are compact and dense, while others are open and thin. They are
                    used in the landscape as informal hedges or screens, foundation plants,
                    specimens, or background for other plants. In the South, they'll stay green
                    throughout the year, while in North Florida hibiscus will freeze to the ground,
                    but usually return from the roots. Tropical hibiscus are sensitive to cold
                    weather; the slightest cold wave can cause lower leaves to yellow and drop off.</p>
                <h4 class="section-title">Native Hibiscus</h4>
                <p class="section-description">There are about 35 species of native hibiscus,
                    also called rosemallows, in the United States. Their flower colors range from
                    white to pink to yellow to red, and their common names are often interchanged
                    (learn more about confusing common names for plants here). One hibiscus native
                    to Florida, Hibiscus coccineus, is also known as the scarlet rosemallow, marsh
                    hibiscus, or swamp mallow. This upright herbaceous perennial can reach a height
                    of 4 to 8 feet. The long leaves of the marsh hibiscus have slender lobes with
                    jagged teeth. Large, gorgeous deep-red flowers appear in mid- to late summer.
                    The marsh hibiscus is often used as a specimen plant in the landscape but may go
                    dormant in the winter. It can also be used around ponds or streams. But while
                    the marsh hibiscus is native to wetland areas—which is where its common name
                    comes from—it is tolerant of somewhat drier soils. This hibiscus requires full
                    sun or partial shade. It can be propagated by seed or division.</p>
                <h4 class="section-title">Pests and Mites</h4>
                <p class="section-description">Scout your hibiscus regularly for pests such as
                    aphids, whiteflies and mealybugs. These piercing sucking insects are usually
                    found in clusters on leaves and flower buds. Scout by flipping leaves and
                    looking for the pests or by noticing sooty mold growing on the honey dew
                    produced. If caught early they are easily controlled with insecticidal soaps or
                    horticulture oils. Be sure to read labels carefully— you should never use the
                    pesticide malathion on hibiscus.</p>

                    An evergreen shurb growing 1-3 meters, the Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flowers
                    frequently in hot and humid conditions. Endemic to south east Asia, Hibiscus
                    rosa-sinensis is grown ornamentally world wide, and is one of the most common
                    plants to use in labratories for its flower. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis does not
                    tolerate cold conditions.
